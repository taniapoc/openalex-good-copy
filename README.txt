To display the dashboard correctly with the most recent data, run the jupyternotebooks in this folder in the following order: 
    1. data pulls > institution overview info.ipynb
            this gets all of the institution-level bibliometrics, publications, and authorship data at a high level
    2. data pulls > pull all sfu works.ipynb 
            this notebook uses the OpenAlex API to download the full set of SFU-affiliated works and publications   
    3. data pulls > topics and subject areas.ipynb
            this notebook identifies and groups the research topics and subject areas of SFU publications
    4. openalex dashboard.ipynb 
            this notebook renders the dashboards

THIS IS ALL SUPER OLD I NEED TO UPDATE A LOT A LOT >:(
