To display the dashboard correctly with the most recent data, run the jupyternotebooks in this folder in the following order: 
    1. data pulls > institution overview info.ipynb
            this gets all of the institution-level bibliometrics, publications, and authorship data at a high level
    2. data pulls > pull all sfu works.ipynb 
            this notebook uses the OpenAlex API to download the full set of SFU-affiliated works and publications   
    3. data pulls > topics and subject areas.ipynb
            this notebook identifies and groups the research topics and subject areas of SFU publications
    4. openalex dashboard.ipynb 
            this notebook renders the dashboards
